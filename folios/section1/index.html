    <h1>Section I – Ailments, Medicines, Recipe & Treatments</h1>

    <p>The following folios form the first section of the Voynich Manuscript.
    They record the <strong>recipes, medicines, and treatments</strong> contained within a
    <strong>Medici-era alchemical medical treatise</strong>, preceding
    <strong>Ficinian Neoplatonism</strong> yet sharing its fusion of
    <strong>philosophy, medicine, and fertility science</strong> — forming a
    <strong>Medici fertility codex</strong> that compiles all
    <strong>ailments, medicines, treatments, and rituals</strong> linked to fertility.</p>

    <p>The folios are <strong>colour-coded</strong>: apart from F1r (the recipe / Master Work for all sap extractions from the real plants), the
    <em>real plants</em> contain <strong>no red or blue pigment</strong>, while the
    <em>fake plants</em> are marked in <strong>red or blue</strong> and represent
    <strong>human anatomical diagrams</strong>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>red and blue anatomical folios</strong> not only depict the
    <strong>remedies themselves</strong>, but also illustrate the
    <strong>underlying humoral and anatomical conditions</strong> they were intended to correct.</p>

    <p>The original practitioner probably did not flip these images, but to follow modern human anatomical diagrams,
    <strong>the figures here have been flipped</strong> to match contemporary orientation.</p>
