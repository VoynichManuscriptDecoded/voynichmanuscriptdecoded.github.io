  <h1>The Voynich Manuscript</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">Decoded</h2>
  <h3 class="section-title">Updates</h3>

                    <div class="update">
    <h2>25th November 2025</h2>
    <p>All folios are being updated and will become clickable on the website as soon as all paperwork is up to date, I've simplified the system so it should be quicker going forward.</p>
  </div>

                  <div class="update">
    <h2>21st November 2025</h2>
    <p>I've taken the folios offline again as I'm simplifying how they are displayed and with the new planetary mappings, lunar phases, the 'c' glyph = World Soul has evolved. I looked at the symbol again, it's the core c shape with a forward projecting line, this has now been relabelled to 'Solar Virtus'. It's not the world soul opening, its the sun's power being channelled.  I'll be updating as soon as humanly possible. </p>
  </div>
  
                  <div class="update">
    <h2>18th November 2025</h2>
    <p>I'm updating but finding a way to combine all this info is challenging, I have day counts, planetary positions, lunar phases and all that's inbetween so you'll have to hang fire while I work out how to display it all correctly and simply! No wonder they used symbols!</p>
  </div>
                <div class="update">
    <h2>18th November 2025</h2>
    <p>It's not only the planets that map but also the moon, the lunar information has now also been added to the planetary positions and mapping</p>
  </div>
  
                    <div class="update">
    <h2>17th November 2025</h2>
    <p>The 'y' update caused all the day counts to change, as a result I decided to try once again to map the planets. I took every planetary occurence across the lines and ran the entire sequence through star map programs and to my amazement they mapped. Every single folio maps to the planets. Every line is a map of the stars. On working this out I realised what I had labelled 'Divine Tone f' behaved the same way as the planets so I check it's position on the star map and realised it's actually Mercury. 'f' is no longer the divine tone it is now the planet Mercury. This had been labelled as g previously so that also had to be re-examined. The glyphs g and m have also evolved and all evolutions are in the key. I'm currently editing all the folios to bring in this new information. All planetary data is also now attached to every folio and the data flow has been simplified. As of this point only UP TO Folio 2r has been updated.</p>
  </div>
                  <div class="update">
    <h2>12th November 2025</h2>
    <p>Going through the folios I started to notice the ambiguity of y and how it was positioned. This bothered me, because the code is so logical. I spent the day re-running y and confirmed it had been mislabelled. y is Midnight — the missing cardinal point. Google Drive & the Folios tab is currently restricted while I update all paperwork and documentation to reflect the change. Even at this point, the code demands absolute logical precision and accuracy, this just changes the day counts in the code as previously y was labelled as start, bridge and end. Overall meaning isn't impacted.</p>

    <h2>30th October 2025</h2>
    <p>Big new find in the De Medici section. The Medici coat of arms isn’t just decoration — it’s the solar orbit code itself. Flip it and you get the same structure as the book: five red suns marking the path, one blue Earth grounding the cycle. I’ve added a new paper and a short video showing exactly how it works — all now live in the De Medici section.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="update">
    <h2>29th October 2025</h2>
    <p>Research into Cosimo de’ Medici’s private gardens and early experiments made me look again at the plant on Folio 1v. I had identified it as lemon, but the evidence now points to bitter orange (<em>Citrus aurantium</em>). The morphology, especially the three-lobed cup and green-yellow leaves, fits orange far better, and historically this was the citrus Cosimo actually cultivated in Florence. Its sap is aromatic and tonic rather than acidic, which matches the page’s theme of male renewal and cleansing.</p>

  <div class="update">

    <h2>27th October 2025</h2>
    <p>Working on the website, will be putting the folios on as soon as possible, please keep checking as I'm updating daily.</p>
