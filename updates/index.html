    <h2>25th February 2026</h2>
    <p>The edits are going quite quickly, I'm unlocking them as I go, you will see the date of the update next to them, I've simplified the system a little and all explanations follow same structure. The change from the ratios to Lyre strings is really beautiful and can actually now be tested by making the correct sound at the precise solar moment.</p>
  </div>

                        <div class="update">
    <h2>23rd February 2026</h2>
    <p>I really didn't want this to evolve again as I can't believe I have to go back and edit all I've done so far but it's the right thing to do, I have to follow where the data leads me and once again it's brought up a huge error in the EVA, I wish I could get away from using the letters but for ease of use on the keyboard I have to stick with them. Following the discovery that the EVA n glyph is two fused symbols — a string selector stroke plus the Sunset upward curl — a further re-examination of the a glyph became necessary. The a shape consists of an open c-curve with a diagonal stroke capping it. Given that the diagonal strokes had just been reidentified as string selectors rather than ratio markers, the diagonal in a was now in question.
The a glyph had previously been decoded as Ground Virtus — the operator's action of capturing or harnessing planetary power. However the diagonal stroke in a is visually identical to the single string selector stroke i. This means a is also a compound glyph — the c-curve carrying the solar source/capture energy, fused with a single diagonal string stroke indicating the first string of the lira da braccio.
The operation previously called Ground Virtus is therefore more precisely understood as the operator sounding the first string of the lira da braccio to hold planetary virtus at that solar moment. The frequency of that specific string is the mechanism by which the virtus is held — the music is not accompanying the operation, it is performing it. This also explains why virtus holding sequences always carry a string instruction — without the string frequency there is nothing to sustain the planetary power between solar moments.
The label has been updated from Ground Virtus to Virtus Held 1 String, and the glyph remains a in the working notation. This means the manuscript is far more musical than I realised. I'm sorry to restrict the folios while I update the code, the overall code hasn't been impacted. What was once sound the octave ratio at sunset now becomes sound the third string at sunset, what was once ground the power is now hold the power with a particular string. All other information remains the same, the anatomical diagrams, the planetary mappings, the day counts, the treatments remain the same, only the music/harmonics have changed. </p>

    <h2>22nd February 2026</h2>
    <p>THE CODE EVOLVED - During analysis of Folio 14r, the final c in the four c Earth symbol (eeee) was found to have an unusual modification — the bottom of the last c extended downward and then curved back upward in a distinctive loop. This upward loop was recognised as the Sunset timing modifier, fused directly into the Earth glyph, indicating Earth applied at the exact point of Sunset rather than the usual approximate window. This was confirmed on Folio 14v where the same upward loop appeared fused to a positional glyph, again following Noon and preceding Midnight, placing it precisely in the Sunset window.
This upward loop as the standalone Sunset marker then prompted a re-examination of the glyph previously labelled n in the EVA transliteration system. What had always appeared to be a single Sunset glyph was now seen differently — the downward stroke and the upward loop are in fact two separate glyphs fused together. The downward stroke is its own instruction, and the upward loop is the Sunset marker attached to it.
Examining what the downward stroke could mean, the existing decode key shows four ratio markers — i, ii, iii, iiii — representing Unison, Octave, Fifth and Fourth. If the downward stroke in n were also a ratio, this would create a fifth ratio, which is not possible within the established Pythagorean harmonic system of four perfect consonances used throughout the manuscript.
However, when the stroke is understood not as a ratio but as a string selector — indicating which specific string of the lira da braccio to play — the system resolves perfectly. The lira da braccio, the instrument played in Florence in the 1400s, had five strings over the fingerboard. One stroke indicates the first string, two strokes the second, and so on up to five. The existing i, ii, iii, iiii markers before d and n are therefore not harmonic ratios but string instructions, telling the practitioner precisely which string to sound at that solar moment. This reframes the entire timing and string system as a direct physical instruction set, consistent with the manuscript's core principle that the code is always simple and visual. The folios will be restricted while I update.</p>

    <h2>15th December 2025</h2>
    <p>I've been really busy teaching so haven't had a lot of time with the book, grammar changed back to project from connect for virtus, I've been really going through the recipe and the instructions are so clear I think it can actually be tested. So I'm going to test it and document it on social media. The whole schedule is 178 days but the Nigredo part is only 34 and at that point it should be visible if there is a change to the sap or not. I an then decide if I want to continue with it or not. I just so happen to have Citrus aurantium at the front of my house, 3 young trees I rescued from the supermarket a few years ago and I've been meaning to move them, I totally forgot about them and when I checked they appear to be the exact ones I need. I also have an old vintage syphon coffee pot I've had for years with a glass stopper so this will also suffice as a glass heatproof flask. I have all that I need so why not!! Mercury isn't in the right position until February so that gives me time to start to collect the sap. I've put some videos up on tiktok. https://www.tiktok.com/@voynichdecoded  </p>

    <h2>8th December 2025</h2>
    <p>Had to update key a little, my grammar and the use of tenses was throwing it out of synch, Vessel receives has gone back to 'Dose Vessel' this is a human interaction, not celestial as I originally thought. And 'Influxus' must also change, in my mind it's always been the channel/the road/the thread that connects the above to the below but it isn't, it's the flow of the power itself, there is no road or channel, it's just the power. So 'Influxus' has changed to 'Draw Virtus'. Key has been updated, folios being done in the background, I'll change the dates on the links once I have finished the edit. </p>
  </div>

                          <div class="update">
    <h2>7th December 2025</h2>
    <p>What I've found is quite incredible, my grammar was affecting the read of the procedures so I spent some time going back through everything. Folio 1r is the recipe for the actual PHILOSOPHERS STONE, using folio 1v bitter orange or citrus sap. If you have an alchemical flask and the sap you could actually run the recipe over the 178 days. This is why that plant is on the back of the folio, they can never be divided. Folio 1v is also medicinal for the next male treatment. It serves 2 purposes, one as the raw material needed to make the philosophers stone and the other as a medicinal treatment for male fertility. The latter follows the timing protocol on the page, the former does not, 1r just requires citrus sap. Citrus sap is different to all other saps, check it yourself.  ALSO the r glyph 'Dose' the label has been changed to Vessel Receives, this is more accurate than Dose but effectively the same thing. </p>

                        <div class="update">
    <h2>5th December 2025</h2>
    <p>Another evolution......... and Lunar Phase is changing to 'Lunar Virtus' the forth Virtus, now we have Natural, Solar (2), Planetary and Lunar. Updates being done as and when I have time</p>
  </div>

                  <div class="update">
    <h2>4th December 2025</h2>
    <p>Following the change with Midnight and the removal of Spiritus/World Soul, the old label “Nous” no longer fit. Further testing shows it must be relabelled. The “2” mark is a modifier attached to the c-glyph. This also made it clear that c is not Solar Virtus — c is simply Virtus (operative power), and the 2 glyph indicates that this instance is Solar Virtus. There are three types of Virtus: solar, planetary, and natural.</p>
  </div>
  
                  <div class="update">
    <h2>1st December 2025</h2>
    <p>Spent some time on the planetary/gallows glyphs, fully understand their shapes now. The glyph shapes are visual mnemonics - simple drawings that help you remember which planet is which by encoding what makes each one distinctive. The '4' pointing left (east) appears on Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus - these are reliable morning stars you can spot before sunrise. Mars and Mercury don't have the '4' because they're not stable eastern risers. Two lines touching the ground means "crosses the whole sky" - Mars and Saturn rise in the east and set in the west in one night. One line touching ground means "doesn't complete the crossing" - Mercury stays in twilight near the Sun, and Jupiter spends months looping backward high overhead instead of simply setting. Venus hugs the horizon (the '4' sits at ground level) because it never rises high. The loops show retrograde motion - small loops for Mars and Saturn's modest backward motion, a big curl for Jupiter's dramatic four-month loop. Each shape draws in one continuous stroke - trace it with your finger like a conductor's gesture, and the motion helps you remember which planet it represents.</p>

    <h2>30th November 2025</h2>
    <p>Every new evolution brings further understanding and with that comes knowledge of how the manuscript works. The 'a' glyph I had marked as Spiritus was bothering me, if something isn't right the code bothers me and this was one of those moments, so as I've been updating I decided to check it again. The symbol clearly shows something descending from above to the horizon. Spiritus wasn't fitting this, so after further research 'Influxus' is the right label. The astral or celestial influence of the Sun (and other planets and stars) on the terrestrial, sublunar world, including the human body and soul. Key has been updated to reflect change as have the updated and open folios</p>

    <h2>21st November 2025</h2>
    <p>I've taken the folios offline again as I'm simplifying how they are displayed and with the new planetary mappings, lunar phases, the 'c' glyph = World Soul has evolved. I looked at the symbol again, it's the core c shape with a forward projecting line, this has now been relabelled to 'Solar Virtus'. It's not the world soul opening, its the sun's power being channelled.  I'll be updating as soon as humanly possible. </p>

    <h2>18th November 2025</h2>
    <p>I'm updating but finding a way to combine all this info is challenging, I have day counts, planetary positions, lunar phases and all that's inbetween so you'll have to hang fire while I work out how to display it all correctly and simply! No wonder they used symbols!</p>

    <h2>18th November 2025</h2>
    <p>It's not only the planets that map but also the moon, the lunar information has now also been added to the planetary positions and mapping</p>
  </div>
  
                    <div class="update">
    <h2>17th November 2025</h2>
    <p>The 'y' update caused all the day counts to change, as a result I decided to try once again to map the planets. I took every planetary occurence across the lines and ran the entire sequence through star map programs and to my amazement they mapped. Every single folio maps to the planets. Every line is a map of the stars. On working this out I realised what I had labelled 'Divine Tone f' behaved the same way as the planets so I check it's position on the star map and realised it's actually Mercury. 'f' is no longer the divine tone it is now the planet Mercury. This had been labelled as g previously so that also had to be re-examined. The glyphs g and m have also evolved and all evolutions are in the key. I'm currently editing all the folios to bring in this new information. All planetary data is also now attached to every folio and the data flow has been simplified. As of this point only UP TO Folio 2r has been updated.</p>
  </div>
                  <div class="update">
    <h2>12th November 2025</h2>
    <p>Going through the folios I started to notice the ambiguity of y and how it was positioned. This bothered me, because the code is so logical. I spent the day re-running y and confirmed it had been mislabelled. y is Midnight — the missing cardinal point. Google Drive & the Folios tab is currently restricted while I update all paperwork and documentation to reflect the change. Even at this point, the code demands absolute logical precision and accuracy, this just changes the day counts in the code as previously y was labelled as start, bridge and end. Overall meaning isn't impacted.</p>

    <p>Big new find in the De Medici section. The Medici coat of arms isn’t just decoration — it’s the solar orbit code itself.

    <h2>29th October 2025</h2>
    <p>Research into Cosimo de’ Medici’s private gardens and early experiments made me look again at the plant on Folio 1v. I had identified it as lemon, but the evidence now points to bitter orange (<em>Citrus aurantium</em>). The morphology, especially the three-lobed cup and green-yellow leaves, fits orange far better, and historically this was the citrus Cosimo actually cultivated in Florence. Its sap is aromatic and tonic rather than acidic, which matches the page’s theme of male renewal and cleansing.</p>
